# angular-card-slider

Card-slider component made in angularJs and fully animated with CSS3.

We have the components Slider and Card.

From the module home/home.controller we can stablish a JSON with the data for the different cards.

The Slider directive implements all the logic of the slide so we can change the directive Card for a new Brand directive, make some necessary changes to adapt the animation and will still working.
